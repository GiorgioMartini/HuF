## How to see the webpage:

To just see it, clonse the repo and open the index.html on the dist folder,

To edit and modify:

- clone repo
- enter in the project folder
- run 'npm install', or 'sudo npm install'
- if u get an error regarding sass, run this: 'sudo npm install gulp-sass --save-dev'
- when it's all working.. you can run 'gulp'

Now to change stuff. you should do it in the src folder... :)

Any questions ask me :)
